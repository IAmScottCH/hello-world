# hello-world

I go by the moniker, "Scott," which I did not choose, but was given to me at the last moment after my birth without much thought by my parents, in order to get out of the hospital.

I've been in the IT business since before the Internet, professionally for over 25 years.  I've been programming since ... um ... 1984?  I like C, C++, PHP is OK, and a variety of other programming languages. I'm not a big fan of short-cut libraries and frameworks, though I'll use them.  To me they just mostly complicate dependencies for the sake of getting a product done as quickly as possible.  Don't argue with me, I'll just find it boring.

I've been a long-time Subversion user, and I still really like it, but there's a lot of GitHub'bing going on these days, and I have to at least keep up some.  The point is, not all my code is in here.

I sometimes make critter costumes and write short stories and draft novels as a couple of my hobbies.

OK, that was a nice intro.  Let's go do something fun and/or useful now!
